# Aza-s-Race
Small platform game created following the Threejs Journey course

A 3D platform game created following "Three.js Journey" with React.js, React-three-fiber, and Rapier physics in which the player controls a ball that can move around a 3D environment, jumping and rolling on platforms. The game was built using React.js as the framework, React-three-fiber as the library for creating 3D scenes, and Rapier physics for handling physics simulations such as character movement and object interactions.  would have likely provided instruction on how to use these technologies to build this small simple game.
