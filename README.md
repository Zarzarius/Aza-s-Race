# Aza-s-Race
Small platform game created following the Threejs Journey course

A 3D platform game created with React.js, React-three-fiber, and Rapier physics would likely be a game in which the player controls a character that can move around a 3D environment, jumping and running on platforms, while also having the ability to interact with objects in the environment. The game would be built using React.js as the framework, React-three-fiber as the library for creating 3D scenes, and Rapier physics for handling physics simulations such as character movement and object interactions. Following "Three js journey 3d course" would have likely provided instruction on how to use these technologies to build this small simple game.
